#  Malignant Tumour Classification using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks
 BSc Project

## Abstract
This project implements a deep convolutional neural network for successfully classifying medical images of the breast cancer cell lines MCF-7 (less aggressive) and MDA-MB-231 (more aggressive) images as well as a non-cancerous breast epithelial cell line in the form of MCD-10A(non-aggressive) with respect to varying degrees of malignancy defined by the differences found in the actin cytoskeleton structures
